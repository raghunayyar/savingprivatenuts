### Team Meetings (15h):
We decided immediately to have regular 2-3 hour meetings every monday and thursday. 
These meetings included all group members. 

### UX Team Contribution (10h):
For the meetings the UX team took it upon ourselves to write the agenda following 
a certain template. We also kept record of every meeting by taking notes, pictures etc. 
Aside from regular agendas we also planned for a creative studio workshop to kickstart 
the initial designs, personas and overall thinking process. The workshop also helped 
define the design problem we wanted to solve together. 

### Presentations (9h):
Throughout the course we had several presentations: project proposal, 
hello world demo, final presentation and KI presentation. These presentation were 
for everyone in the group.

### UX Team Contribution (25h):
We in the UX team held all of the presentation except the project proposal. 
One was doing the presenting while the other was doing the demo:ing. We had to 
write a script on what to say as well as what part of the program we wanted to 
demo. For the final KI presentation we also created the slide. 

### Coordination (20h):
Because we couldn’t take too much of the KI staffs time we took it upon 
ourselves to coordinate our team. We did this through personal deadlines 
and goals, inter-team communication as well as continuous motivation of
all the group members to get tasks done. Because we did most of the 
documentation we also had the most information in the group and thus 
became the “go-to” guys. 

### User Testing (20h):
This section entails the main focus of the UX team. We held all customer 
contact, including e-mails, phone calls and meetings. We planned for all 
the user testings and evaluations made throughout the process - including 
interviews, state-of-the-art evaluations, heuristic evaluations and think-alouds. 
We also had to summarize those findings to communicate the needs of our users to 
the rest of our team.  

### Other:

#### Dani (3h): 
I did some data cleaning in the form of a date-parser. 

#### Summary (total: 99h):
In summary we coordinated the team by motivating each member, planning regular meetings, setting up personal deadlines and making sure members followed through on them. We also held the position of inter-group contact because we documented everything and held the most interdisciplinary information. Because we also held the presentations and had the most contact with the customers we became the “face” of the group.
