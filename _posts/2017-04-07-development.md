# Development

## Coordination

### Niek
We met with the whole team twice each week to generate ideas, coordinate the project and
to decide the tasks of the subteams (design, coding, evaluation). Subsequently we met up with
the design team to prepare design sessions, the creation of interactive prototypes for the user
evaluation and to prepare presentations.

### Tomás
Our team tried to stick to a tight meeting schedule, with regular meetings twice per week.
With structured time slots, in order to avoid postponing meetings and tasks due to schedule
conflicts. This meeting where whole team, the specific teams had their own schedules and work
process. The design team met mostly to discuss design ideas, sketches and layouts before discussing
them with the whole team

### Julia
The whole team met up twice a week to discuss progress, future work, generate ideas, and to coordinate and
divide tasks between members/sub teams. Me, Niek and Tomás met up as well to work with design tasks. Both
the main group and the design group have been using slack as a communication medium when we haven’t met.
I believe it has worked well.


## Unimplemented features

### Niek
I proposed an iterated design based on the user feedback from Markus & Johan which included
a way to visualize data which was saved or exported. This way not implemented due to the increased
workload on the coding team and therefore we decided to exclude this feature from the program.

### Tomás
In my first sketches, our tool was much more complex, combining different visual structures and even  providing
individualized patient data. This was not implemented due to the complexity and overlapping with other group’s projects.
Also, I designed our website. However, due to technical reasons (the program I used to design it created some issues
for the coder to put it online), it was not used the way I intended.

### Julia
Except for the initial sketches that we all did, I wouldn’t say I proposed any major tasks in
general, so there weren’t any to be denied. I mainly suggested smaller (often design related)
features to the project.


## Lessons learned

### Niek
In this project I have learned how to work with a team with diverse skillsets. In my bachelor I have
worked with students with similar skillsets in design, which would result in a project which was visually
attractive yet had minimal functionality. My team members have a range of skills (coding, user evaluation,
data analysis) which I have combined with mine, resulting in a project that I am proud of.

Feedback from the team during the design process is important. In my workflow I have a tendency to create
the ‘perfect’ design after one group meeting, however in this project we have put effort into organizing multiple
design sessions in which the group would give feedback based on our proposals.

I learned that the look & feel of a design in the initial phase of the project has to be sketchy and not
refined, otherwise the feedback will focus on details rather than the idea. Also it is likely that the time
and effort that was put into the details will be lost since the components and features are changing throughout the project.

### Tomás
This was probably one of the most diverse teams I have ever worked. And I mean this both in terms of professional
background (a mix of designers and coders) and culture (we had 6 different nationalities in the group). Naturally, one
can learn a lot from  such experience.

For example, working closely with coders was fun,  but created a new work process for me. I was used to think only
about aesthetics and usability, but not in the technical perspective. Having a technical team to discuss raised new
questions and really practical one. More than once, we heard that the idea was nice, but we could not implement that.

Other point was to have a close contact with the final user. Having actual users trying our ideas during the
process was a textbook example of how having this iterative process can make designs better.

There were a lot of lessons to be learned. But I think that this project  gave me an amazing overview of a
complete design process, from brainstorming, to testing,  to coding, to prototyping.


### Julia
This project has been very valuable in the sense that I’ve been able to experience to work with people
that have varied skillsets and backgrounds. Programmers, designers, and some that have experience in
user evaluations etc. I have a background in media technology (from Södertörn University) where I learned
quite little about a lot and therefore this has been a very interesting project for me. There I rather
quickly found my role in group projects and stuck to it (I was mainly focusing on managing groups I was
in) which limited my learning. In this project I know I’ve been less keen to display my ideas because
I’m not yet comfortable with my own skillsets, but instead I’ve tried to learn as much as I can by
observing and trying to help. From this I’ve learned that I do need to work on raising my voice when I
believe I have something to contribute with/learn from.

What I’ve learned from most is the design exercises we’ve done, as well as listening/observing and
asking Niek about design and film-parts of the project. I have some prior experience within design and
film but on a highly amateur-level and it’s been great to learn from him.
