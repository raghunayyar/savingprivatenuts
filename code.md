## Coordination

#### Nilay, Raghu, Mai-Khanh
The whole team met twice a week, about two-three hours each time, to discuss 
progress, what each team managed to do since the last meeting, and future tasks. 
On another hand, the programming team (Nilay, Raghu and I) constantly talked with 
each other in order to divide the work between us so as to not overlap, and check 
each other’s work when a task was done to validate everything. We used github and 
trello for project management.


### Features that were not kept:

- Old sankey (colors and nodes names)
- Color-pairing sankey and pc (old colors)
- Clickable links (instead of nodes)


### Lessons learned


#### Nilay, Raghu, Mai-Khanh
The major aspect of this project was most definitely working in a team that is a melting pot of skills and nationalities, which was quite interesting and new. 
Since in the past I only worked in teams with programmers only, I realised that working with designers takes a big load off coders’ shoulders and helps making a more polished looking final application.
All in all, the biggest lesson learned during the project is the process of working with different types of people and compromising, as well as adapting the workflow so that everybody can be satisfied.
